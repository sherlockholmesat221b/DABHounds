*Commits Made*: 3eee5b4, 69ee66b, d4ed2a9, 55253df

#### Added
- Minimal configurations in the config file for downloads.
- Metadata tagging functionality, including embedding covers.
- Support for downloading `.m3u8` files.

#### Improved
- Downloader now outputs progress and can be paused.
- Metadata tagging is now stable and smooth.

#### Notes / TODO
- Download directory is still inside the code directory; consider moving it outside for cleaner structure.
- Filenames generated by the downloader are not yet desirable.
- Quality/format selection (configurable via `config.json`) needs to be implemented.
- Overall downloader is still unstable; further stabilization required.
- Add a `dabhounds config` command to print the configuration directory.
- Turns out, you can have TODO.md and DEVLOGS.md files.
- Moved dabhounds inside src.
- Ensure that after downloadig is finished echo is turned on.
#### Fixed
- *(None for this session)*
